## BLSMARTFLOW

The BLSmartflow is an ESP32 based device that connects to your Bambulab X1,X1C,P1P Or P1S and controls fans based on the temperature of the printer.

### Features

- Connects to Bambulab H2D,X1,X1C,P1P Or P1S
- Controls Fans based on printer temperature

### BL Smart Flow+ Features

- Synchronized or independent control of both fans
- Per-fan temperature curve editing
- Per-fan static speed overrides
- Per-fan following the reported speed of a printer fan
- Separate animated fan indicators

### Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the release history.

### Development Environment

To contribute to the Smartflow project, you'll need the following tools:

### Tools & Libraries Used

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A lightweight and powerful source code editor.
- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/): An open-source ecosystem for IoT development.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/): A programming language used for scripting and automation.
- [qpdf](https://qpdf.sourceforge.io/): A command-line tool and library of compression tools (`gzip`)

### Building and Running the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Ensure that PlatformIO is installed and configured in your Visual Studio Code environment.
4. Connect your Smartflow device ESP32 to your computer.
6. Build the project by clicking on the PlatformIO icon in the sidebar and selecting "Build" from the available options.
7. Once the build process is complete, upload the firmware to your device using the "Upload" option in PlatformIO.
8. After uploading the firmware, your BLSmartflow device should be ready to use.

### Setup Instructions
Once you have uploaded the firmware to your device, please visit the [dutchdevelop.com/blsmartflow](https://www.dutchdevelop.com/blsmartflow) website for detailed setup instructions.


### Development Notes

#### Firmware Versioning

Versions use **major.feature.build**: the first number changes for a major overhaul, the middle number for feature additions, and the last number increments for every firmware build.

`version_build.py` reserves the next build number in `platformio.ini` before compiling, including when Upload builds new firmware. A failed build still consumes its number. Cleaning, IDE metadata, filesystem-only operations, and uploading an existing binary with `nobuild` do not increment it. Commit the updated `custom_version` with the changes being built. When starting a new feature series or major version, update the corresponding number in `custom_version`; the next build increments its final number as usual.

The compiler and `.firmware` output filenames use the same reserved version. The displayed date comes from the build machine's local date. Web pages load the version from the firmware instead of keeping a separate hardcoded copy.

#### Independent Fan Control

**Synchronize Fans: On** uses Fan 1's curve and static-speed override for both outputs. This is also the default after upgrading from 1.0.x. Fan 1 is GPIO 17; Fan 2 is GPIO 16. Both curves use the printer's nozzle temperature.

Set synchronization to **Off** and save to configure the fans separately. Fan 2 initially copies Fan 1's current settings. The Fan Graph page shows both curves; the **Edit curve** switch selects **Fan 1** on the left and **Fan 2** on the right. Clicking a point also selects its fan and opens the editor; overlapping points prefer the currently selected fan. Valid point changes save automatically, with a confirmation that disappears after four seconds. Each fan's static-speed switch overrides its own curve with the entered percentage.

Switching synchronization back On preserves Fan 2's curve and static settings, including across restarts. Switching Off again restores them. Configuration changes take effect after a successful Save; unsaved changes to the synchronization selector do not change the running fan mode.

The existing HTTP endpoints remain available: `points` and `speed` still describe Fan 1. `/getFanConfig` adds `points2` and `fansSynchronized`; `/sensorData` adds `speed2`. To update a specific curve, POST `fan=1` or `fan=2` to `/updateFanConfig` alongside the existing `points` form field containing `{"points":[{"temp":0,"speed":0},...]}`. Omitting `fan` selects Fan 1.

#### Follow Printer Fan

Below each **Static Fan Speed** row, enable **Follow Printer Fan**, choose a source, and save. The output mirrors that printer fan's reported percentage. The two switches are mutually exclusive, and either can always be switched off. When both are off, the output uses its temperature curve. **Synchronize Fans: On** applies Fan 1's settings to both outputs; switching it Off restores Fan 2's saved settings. The selected source appears in white below the speed indicator after a successful save.

| Source | MQTT field | Indicator label |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Part Cooling Fan | `print.cooling_fan_speed` | Part Cooling Fan |
| Auxiliary Cooling Fan | `print.big_fan1_speed` | Auxiliary Fan |
| Chamber/Exhaust Fan | `print.big_fan2_speed` | Chamber Fan |
| Hotend/Heatbreak Fan | `print.heatbreak_fan_speed` | Hotend Fan |

The packed `print.fan_gear` field contains three 0–255 values (part, auxiliary, chamber) and takes precedence when present. Those values are rounded to the nearest 10% step to match [Bambu Studio's fan display](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/blob/master/src/slic3r/GUI/Widgets/FanControl.cpp). For example, PWM 180 becomes 70%, not 71%. Separate 0–15 fields for these three fans use `floor(raw / 1.5) * 10`, matching [Bambu Studio's decoder](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/blob/master/src/slic3r/GUI/DeviceCore/DevFan.cpp). Hotend/heatbreak readings use a separate 0–15 scale and are converted to the nearest whole percentage. These are reported speed levels, not RPM measurements; a source is usable only if the printer reports it. Static speeds and curve speeds are not rounded to 10% steps.

Each source starts at **0% after boot** and keeps its last valid speed when MQTT disconnects, a field is omitted, or a value is malformed. An explicitly reported zero stops the following output. Speeds are kept in RAM; only the follow settings are saved to flash. Existing configurations load with following Off.

`/getOptions` and `/submitOptions` add `followPrinterFan` and `printerFanSource` (and `followPrinterFan2` / `printerFanSource2`). Sources are `part`, `auxiliary`, `chamber`, or `heatbreak`. The form posts explicit `on`/`off` values; requests enabling both overrides are rejected. `/sensorData` adds `printerFans`, containing each source's last percentage or `null` before its first report.

#### Tests

After a PlatformIO build has installed dependencies, run:

```sh
node --test test/settings-page.test.js
python3 test/version_build_test.py
python3 test/run-host-tests.py
```

The native tests use the production firmware handlers and ArduinoJson with simulated flash, HTTP, and GPIO I/O, plus address and undefined-behavior sanitizers. Physical fan operation and a power-cycle check should also be verified on the device after an OTA update.

#### Generating .h Files for Compressed HTML

In embedded applications, HTML content is efficiently stored in PROGMEM memory. To achieve this, .h files are generated from compressed HTML files for webpages (i.e., `src/www/setuppage.html`) that are run on the device.

- `pre_build.py` runs automatically through `platformio.ini`, compressing web assets into `src/www/www.h` and regenerating the individual `fanpage.h`, `updatePage.h`, and `favicon.h` headers used by the web server.
- Rebuild after editing HTML or the favicon so the generated headers and firmware contain the updated assets.

The favicon overlays the fan blades on the shell, preserving transparency. To regenerate its 16, 32, 48, and 64 pixel sizes with ImageMagick, run:

```sh
magick src/www/smartflow_shell.png src/www/smartflow_blades.png -compose over -composite -define icon:auto-resize=64,48,32,16 src/www/favicon.ico
```
